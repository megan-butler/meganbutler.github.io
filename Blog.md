Blog of first day RedHat TY Programme

When I came in at the start of the day we got a talk about the company including what the company is and what the companies aims and goals are which was helpful as I didn’t know too much about what exactly is done, I only had a general idea. I noticed there wasn’t too many other girls also participating in the programme which I really liked as no one could really get too overwhelmed when there isn’t too many people in a room that they aren’t familiar with. There was also interns who were very helpful if any questions needed to be asked. We did an icebreaker game and in doing so everyone started talking to each other and it worked very well. After this we went on a tour which was really cool to see all the desks/office space, different rooms and facilities. After the tour we went and played games on a nintendo which was really good as everyone started talking more and the original awkwardness was gone. We then got our lunch break where we all got t eat and talk, it was nice to be able to meet everyone and get to know them. We went back after lunch and did an agile workshop. I really liked the way Fortune delivered the workshop as he explained everything really well, took his time and made it humorous when necessary which made it more enjoyable too. I learned a lot of new things as I wasn’t too sure what agile or agility meant previous to the workshop. We did a building exercise in which we were split into two teams and we had to build a product while adapting to change throughout the process which linked in the agility. I really enjoyed this as it was fun and I learned a lot.
